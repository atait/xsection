# XSection

This is a fork of the former xsection@klayout project on SourceForge. It's been turned into a 
KLayout package now and is available through KLayout's new package manager (available from 0.25).

The goal of this project is to provide an add-on to KLayout (www.klayout.de) to 
create and visualize a realistic cross-section view for VLSI designs supporting a wide range of 
technology options.
